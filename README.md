# python-Learning
This repository showcases my progress in Python, from beginner to whatever level I ultimately achieve. It contains solutions to exercises from various books (I know, old-fashioned). These solutions can be useful for people using the same books who are looking for answers, or for employers interested in reviewing my work. I cover a wide range of books because different authors offer unique perspectives and exercises 
It is currently a work in progress so updtes will be made regularly
