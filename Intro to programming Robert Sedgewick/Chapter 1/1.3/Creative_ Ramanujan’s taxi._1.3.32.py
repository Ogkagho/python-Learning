# Ramanujanâ€™s taxi. cool problem
#compose a program that takes a command-line argument n and writes all integers less than 
#or equal to n that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways. 
#In other words, find distinct positive integers a, b, c, and d such that a3 + b3 = c3 + d3. 
#Use four nested for loops.
#try 1729 as input
