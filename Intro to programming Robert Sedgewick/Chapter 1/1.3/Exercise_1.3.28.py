#Compose a program gcd.py that finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) 
#of two integers using Euclidâ€™s algorithm, which is an iterative computation based on 
#the following observation: if x is greater than y, then if y divides x, the gcd of x and 
#y is y; otherwise, the gcd of x and y is the same as the gcd of x % y and y
